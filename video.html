    <p>China’s activities in the UAE extend beyond investments.</p>
    <p>
      In January 2020, a three-vessel PLAN task force stopped for five days at
      Khalifa Port and visited a nearby UAE military base. The port call was one
      of many in the area that has supported Chinese anti-piracy escort missions
      in the Gulf of Aden, which have been ongoing since 2008. These port calls
      advance China’s military diplomacy and enable replenishing of Chinese
      vessels as they operate in surrounding seas.

      There is some evidence that China desires a more permanent military
      presence in the UAE. The Department of Defense lists the UAE among the
      countries where the PLA has considered establishing overseas military
      facility. In 2021, Khalifa Port was at the center of a controversy when
      U.S. intelligence agencies accused China of secretly beginning to
      construct a military facility at the port. Reports suggest that Washington
      warned Emirati officials about China’s activities and China appeared to
      stop work on the facility in question.

      A new facility would go a long way toward expanding China’s naval
      presence, but the PLA would not need a sprawling base at Khalifa Port (or
      elsewhere) to project power into the Strait of Hormuz. Even a light
      footprint could assist the PLA in sustaining expeditionary operations. A
      limited logistics facility, for instance, could store prepositioned
      dual-use goods such as petroleum, basic maintenance equipment, food, and
      water.
